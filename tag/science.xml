   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some interesting information about what happens to our Body during fasting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detoxification Stage 1 (Day 1 To Day 2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the first day of fasting, the blood sugar level drops. The heart slows and blood pressure is reduced. Glycogen is pulled from the muscle causing some weakness. The first wave of cleansing is usually the worst. Headaches, dizziness, nausea, bad breath, and a heavily coated tongue are signs of the first stage of cleansing. Hunger can be the most intense in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detoxification Stage 2 (Day 3 To Day 7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fats, composed of transformed fatty acids, are broken down to release glycerol from the gliceride molecules and are converted to glucose. The skin may become oily as rancid oils are purged from the body. People with problem-free skin may have a few days of pimples or even a boil. The body embraces the fast and the digestive system is able to take a much-needed rest, focusing all of its energies on cleansing and healing. White blood cell and immune system activity increases. You may feel pain in your lungs. The cleansing organs and the lungs are in the process of being repaired. The breath is still foul and the tongue coated. Within the intestine, the colon is being repaired and impacted feces on the intestinal wall start to loosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detoxification Stage 3 (Day 8 to Day 15)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will experience enhanced energy, clear-mindedness and feel better. On the downside, old injuries may become irritated and painful. This is a result of the body’s increased ability to heal during fasting. If you had broken your arm 10 years before, there is scar tissue around the break. At the time of the break, the body’s ability to heal was directly related to lifestyle. If you lived on a junk-food diet, the body’s natural healing ability was compromised. During fasting, the body’s healing process is at optimum efficiency. As the body scours for dead or damaged tissue, the lymphocytes enter the older, damaged tissue secreting substances to dissolve the damaged cells. These substances irritate the nerves in the surrounding region and cause a reoccurrence of aches from previously injured areas that may have disappeared years earlier. The pain is good as the body is completing the healing process. The muscles may become tight and sore due to toxin irritation. The legs can be the worst affected, as toxins accumulate in the legs. Cankers are common in this stage due to the excessive bacteria in the mouth. Daily gargling with salt and water will prevent or heal cankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detoxification Stage 4 (Day 16 to Day 30)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The body is completely adapted to the fasting process. There is more energy and clarity of mind. Cleansing periods can be short with many days of feeling good in between. There are days when the tongue is pink and the breath is fresh. The healing work of the organs is being completed. After the detoxification mechanisms have removed the causative agent or render it harmless, the body works at maximum capacity in tissue proliferation to replace damaged tissue. After day 20, the mind is affected. Heightened clarity and emotional balance are felt at this time. Memory and concentration improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;~Happy Fasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
